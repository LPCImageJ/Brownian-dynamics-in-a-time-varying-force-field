A python code to calculate the Brownian motion of a colloidal particle in a time varying force field. The code was developed for the research work of the <a href = "https://hesselink-lab.stanford.edu"> Hesselink research group </a>  at Stanford University. The particle trajectory computed by the code can be useful for designing lab-on-a-chip devices. Please cite this repository when using this code.

The current example code shows the transport of a micro-particle along a moving micro-electrode array producing moving dielectrophoretic force. As the micro-electrodes are excited in sequence, the micro-particle follows the position of the active electrode.

The Brownian motion code solves the Langevin equation in discrete time. The code is general. Although the example considers a dielectrophoretic force-field, the code would work for any type of external force-field. The code would also work for nano-particles instead of micro-particles. The Brownian vibrations are more prominent for nano-particles.  

The python script was tested with spyder IDE.
